            <h3>Summary</h3>
              <p>
                  There is research which suggests that our constant exposure to <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/development-and-psychopathology/article/the-roles-of-social-withdrawal-peer-rejection-and-victimization-by-peers-in-predicting-loneliness-and-depressed-mood-in-childhood/0537373B9B1F5FA18CFD6BC785122BAA">
                  social media these days impacts our moods.</a> This is not just found in adults but children too as referenced in
                  the article. Given these variations in mood, I feel that it is important that people pay more attention to their moods
                  and the impact this has on their emotions on a day-to-day basis.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Enter Tranquilo - a mobile app that helps users measure their moods throughout the day and, in the long-term, seeks to
                  help users gain more control over their moods and how they react to situations.
              </p>
              <p class="insight"><font color="black">Product Mission</font><br />Tranquilo seeks to make users cognizant of their mood
                over the day and through that exercise more control over their reactions to external stimuli
              </p>
            <h3>Process</h3>
              <p>
                  The inspiration for this product came up as an assignment for one of my courses in grad school. The aim of the assignment
                  was to find something that students were not currently tracking or measuring and then coming up with a solution for the
                  same. I've always wanted to measure mood, specifically my reactions to external stimuli and how they affect me, short-term
                  and long-term.

                <figcaption>The main ideas focused on written measurement, oral measurement and measurement with a wearable device</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>
                  As I thought of ideas that I would use to measure mood, I came up with three ideas:
                  <ol>
                    <li>Oral measurement: in this method, the user would speak out their emotions to the app using their mobile phone when
                      asked to by the app. The app would keep track of their mood by asking them to record their moods at various times of
                      the day. Users will then be able to view their responses at the end of the day to see how their moods have changed
                      over the course of the day.</li>
                    <li>Written measurement: in this method, the user would write out their emotions to the app in the form of an online
                      diary entry. The app, using sentiment analysis would figure out how the user's moods would change over time and
                      provide feedback to the user about their moods.</li>
                    <li>Wearable device: in this method, the user straps on a wearable device on their arm (kind of like a wrist-watch),
                      that measures their pulse and detects any anomalies such as sudden panic or euphoria. This is then displayed to the
                      user at the end of the day so that they can observe their behavior.</li>
              </p>

              <p><b>User interviews</b></p>
              <p>
                  In order to figure out the best way of going forward, I decided to talk to potential users and ask them how they felt
                  about these ideas. The persons I contacted for interview requests were students and faculty at the University of Michigan.
                  I also spoke to some others such as family members and friends who were not in academics so that I get feedback from
                  people of different backgrounds. Many users liked the idea of a journal or diary entry as they did used to maintain these
                  when they were younger. However, the effort to write a diary entry every day that required them to recollect every incident
                  during the day appeared tedious. Users also expressed some hesitation in speaking out to the phone (oral measurement) in
                  public talking about what they are going through and voicing personal concerns into a device.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Users were very interested in the idea of a wearable. They felt that it would help them achieve what they wanted and yet not
                  in a manner that seemed too conspicuous. They were insistent that the wearable should not prompt them too often asking
                  them how they were feeling and should be able to recognize normal changes in pulse or heart rate such as when one is
                  exercising.
              </p>
              <p class="insight"><font color="black">Interviewee Quote</font><br />"That sounds great. Wearables are in right now and it would
                be interesting in using one that helps me monitor. However, I don't want it to ask me what's wrong when I'm in the middle of 
                a workout!"
              </p>
            <p><b>Concept Sketching</b></p>
              <p>
                  The project itself aims at being a personal informatics application. Drawing upon theories of personal informatics design such as Norm Activation
                  and “The Rider and the Elephant” (Haidt, 2006), Droplet encourages and enables users to make better in-the-moment behavior changes.

              <p><img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/droplet/droplet_key_features.png" alt=""></p>
              <p><b>On-demand water footprint score</b></p>
              <p>
                  The app allows users to scan an item's barcode and receive information about the item's water footprint instantaneously.
                  This information is sourced from the app's database which contains an extensive collection of water footprints of various
                  commonly purchased products. Droplet also displays less water-intensive alternatives for purchase.
              <p>

                </figure>
              </p>
              <p><b>Encouragement</b></p>
              <p>
                  One of the covenants of Personal Informatics Design is the need to offer encouragement to the user. A major challenge facing designers today is the
                  28-day problem — the fact that many users do not continue using apps beyond 28 days. In order to keep the user interested, we sought to show the user
                  just how far they have come in their journey towards improving their water footprint. We did this in a simple manner — through words of encouragement
                  and comparing a numerical value into normal terms such as the amount of water needed for a routine task like showering.
              </p>

                  </figure>
              </p>
              <p><b>Self-reporting at the supermarket or restaurant</b></p>
              <p>
                  Droplet allows users to self report their water footprint while on a trip to the grocery store or while getting takeout at a restaurant through the app’s
                  virtual shopping cart.
              </p>
