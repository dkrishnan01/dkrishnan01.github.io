            <h3>Summary</h3>
              <p>
                  I worked at FICO [Fair, Isaac and Co.], Ann Arbor from May 2017 - December 2017 as a Product Development Intern. I worked
                  with the Cybersecurity team reporting to the VP of Product Management as part of a 10-member team. My main focus was on
                  developing an in-house data management system that development and support teams used to maintain customer information.
              </p>
            <h3>About the company</h3>
              <p>
                  FICO, originally Fair, Isaac and Company, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FICO">data analytics company</a>
                  based in San Jose, California focused on credit scoring services. It was founded by Bill Fair and Earl Isaac in 1956.
                  In 2016, FICO
                  <a href="https://www.xconomy.com/detroit-ann-arbor/2016/06/15/fico-buys-quadmetrics-to-help-measure-corporate-cybersecurity-risk/">
                  acquired a company in Ann Arbor, MI called Quadmetrics Inc.</a> to help measure corporate cybersecurity risk. They measure
                  a corporation’s vulnerability (or strength) such as exposure to hackers and other cybersecurity dangers. Think of it as a credit
                  score for corporations instead of individuals.
              </p>
            <h3>My Role:</h3>
              <p>
                  I was recruited as the only intern for the summer of 2017. The first two weeks of my internship were spent in understanding
                  the various products the company had on their product roster and figuring out the internal workings of the organization and my
                  team as a whole. After that, I was given my goal for the summer.
              </p>
            <h3>The Product:</h3>
              <p>
                  I was tasked with designing and developing Admin Tools - an in-house client data management system that the Cybersecurity team
                  used to onboard new customers into the system.
              </p>
              <p><i>Now</i></p>
              <p>
                  Currently, the way new clients would be onboarded was by having them send their information to an Client Relationship Manager who
                  would then forward that to a mailbox that was monitored by the Cybersecurity team. Upon receipt of the email one of the team members,
                  who was comfortable in SQL, would create a record for that client and add in the product subscriptions that the client wished to
                  subscribe to. This would be done through an INSERT SQL statement. It was viewed as cumbersome and dangerous as it involved adding
                  records directly into production databases. Any modifications in customer information would also be required. Since this was a new
                  team there was no alternative at the time and it was important to have clients onboarded quickly.
              </p>
              <p><i>Next</i></p>
              <p>
                  The goal was to have this entire process made easier. The team wanted to do away with email, having the customer directly submit
                  their intent to subscribe to a product on the website. This would then get sent to the Cybersecurity team who would validate the
                  data and finally approve or reject the customer based on the data provided. The product roll-out was divided into 3 phases:
              </p>

                </figure>
              </p>
            <h3>Process:</h3>

                <figure>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/fico/fico_process.png" alt="">

                </figure>
              </p>
              <p><b>User Interviews:</b></p>
              <p>
                  I conducted user interviews with developers on the team to see how they entered data into the system. I also watched as they input
                  data into the system recording the order and format in which the various data points were input. I also requested feedback from
                  them - asking them to share with me what they would like to be able to do in a simple manner and more importantly what their dream
                  system would look like.
              </p>
              <p><b>Personas:</b></p>
              <p>
                  Personas were skipped in this specific project because the end users were very clearly known - it was a select group of individuals
                  at FICO who would be using the software. A decision was made to roll-out phases 1 and 2 of this product first and then revisit phase
                  3 if needed at a later point. Since phase 3 would need customers to enter data themselves, that would need further research which at
                  this point was not viable.
              </p>
              <p><b>Lo-Fi Protoype:</b></p>
              <p>
                  I began work on a lo-fi prototype by sketching workflows for the system. The workflows basically were a run-through of how the system
                  would flow from page-to-page.
              </p>

                </figure>
              </p>
              <p><b>Design Decisions</b></p>
              <p>
                  One of the major drawbacks of such a system was that the number of fields that needed to be entered were fairly high in number. In
                  order to reduce some of this effort, we decided to have automated entry for some fields such as date and organization ID by using
                  the user login information to fetch organization ID.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Another design decision made was to make use of modals when editing data. Owing to the use of multiple pages in the application, it
                  was difficult for developers to go back and forth between pages. So, in order to make that flow from editing a record to going back
                  and checking other information, modals were used. Clicking on an entry opened up a modal which allowed developers to edit records
                  and then clicking "Confirm" to close the modal. A highlighted message at the top of the screen would be displayed confirming that
                  the change was saved successfully.
              </p>
              <p><b>User feedback:</b></p>
              <p>
                  I presented the wireframes and lo-fi pictures to the team in-charge of maintaining the database and sought their feedback. Based on
                  the feedback presented I created a hi-fi prototype of the final product.
              </p>
              <p class="insight"><font color="black">Note</font><br />The Hi-fi prototype is unavailable for viewing here owing to a very strict NDA.
              </p>
              <h3>Product Development</h3>
              <p>
                  My previous experience in software development and engineering came in handy at this role. After the design of the system we had to
                  physically code it from scratch. Along with my mentor, we worked on crafting the system with Python Flask and SQL Alchemy. While my
                  mentor worked on the back-end using SQL Alchemy I worked on the front-end of the system using Python Flask, HTML and CSS, ensuring
                  that the system was making timely API calls and using caching to make the data recovery and storage more efficient.
              </p>
              <h3>Reflection:</h3>
              <p>
                This project required that I learn a new programming language - Python Flask. The whole project was an amazing experience and taught
                me to not only design in the real world but also engineer a product after the design. I specifically learned how to apply design principles
                from an engineering perspective and understood some of the challenges engineers face while designing to specifications. This has helped me
                become a better designer and also helped me foster meaningful cross-team relationships.
